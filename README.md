# Anime Matchmaker üíñ

A personalized anime recommender connecting you to shows you'll love through tailored suggestions.

## Overview

Anime Matchmaker is a web application that helps users discover new anime based on their mood, watch history, and personal preferences. The app suggests anime titles tailored to each user's taste by leveraging AI-powered recommendations.

Client-side code can be found here: [https://github.com/dpurkays/anime-matchmaker](https://github.com/dpurkays/anime-matchmaker) 

### Problem Space

Finding the right anime can be overwhelming due to the large volume of anime. While most recommendations rely on basic genre filtering, google searches or even just watching the latest hottest anime, leaving many undiscovered.

### User Profile

- **Anime Enthusiasts:** Users who would want better recommendations beyond simple genre-based filtering
- **Casual Viewers:** Users looking for animes that match their mood, whether it's action-packed, romcom, or wholesome romance.
- **New to Anime**: Users who are unfamiliar with anime and need guidance based on their favorite movies or TV shows.

### Features

- **Mood-Based Anime Search:** Users select a mood (e.g. "Chill & Relaxing", "High-Energy Action Packed") to get anime suggestions.
- **AI-powered recommendations:** Uses Gemini AI to analyse a user's watch list history and suggest relevant anime suggestions.

  > _Note: "Watch list history" refers to the user‚Äôs public favorites or watch history list visible on their MyAnimeList profile._

- **Movie/TV show-based recommendations:** New users can enter a favorite Movie or TV show, and the app suggests similar anime.
